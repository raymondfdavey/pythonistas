# Generate a sequence of integer numbers in the pattern 0, 2, 4, ..., up to 20
# inclusive and display the numbers on the screen.

x = 0
# Your solution here...


# Allow the user to enter a string, and then print out each letter
# in the string one at a time on a separate line.

string = input('Enter some text: ')
# Your solution here...


# As above, but print out the letters in the string in reverse order.

string = input('Enter some text: ')
# Your solution here...


# Starting with the initial value 0 and 1, generate a Fibonacci sequence.
# Each element in a Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the two previous
# elements e.g. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...
# Allow the user to specify how many elements should be generated.

x = int(input('How many elements? '))
