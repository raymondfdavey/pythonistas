"""
This class is the main class of the "Adventure World" application.
'Adventure World' is a very simple, text based adventure game. Users can walk
around some scenery. That's all. It should really be extended to make it more
interesting!

To play this game, create an instance of this class and call the "play" method.

This main class creates and initialises all the others: it creates all rooms,
creates the parser and starts the game. It also evaluates and executes the
commands that the parser returns.

This game is adapted from the 'World of Zuul' by Michael Kolling and 
David J. Barnes. The original was written in Java and has been simplified and
converted to Python by Kingsley Sage.
